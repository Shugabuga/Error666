Error 666: This is just a dialog box. Nothing else. It does not have an output, but literally just has the popup.
It does have a title. It it 'Error 666' and can be changed.
The button is a 'cancel' button. If you want to change the text, it's 'OK'
Also, this is a script file. You would have to re-save it as an application, using 'Export' under the 'File' menu, or saving it for the first time.

Have fun!
